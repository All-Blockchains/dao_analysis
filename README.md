# dao_analysis
Various analyses of The DAO and its transactions

This is where I keep most of the work I do to look into The DAO transactions. 

Most work is done in [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)

Information is retrieved using my [Python bindings to the EtherScan.io API](https://github.com/corpetty/py-etherscan-api.git)

## Static DAO information
All reference information that may be considered static can be found in the [reference_material](https://github.com/corpetty/dao_analysis/tree/master/reference_material) directory
